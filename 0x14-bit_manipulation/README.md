### Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves manipulating individual bits within a binary representation of data. It allows you to perform various operations at the bit level, such as setting, clearing, toggling, or checking the value of specific bits.

This repository provides a collection of common bit manipulation techniques and algorithms implemented in various programming languages. It serves as a reference for developers who want to understand and utilize the power of bit manipulation in their code.

The repository includes the following:

Bitwise Operators: An explanation of bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) and their usage in bit manipulation.
Bitwise Shift Operators: An overview of bitwise shift operators (left shift, right shift) and their applications.
Bitwise Manipulation Techniques: A set of commonly used techniques for manipulating bits, such as setting, clearing, toggling, and checking specific bits.
Bitwise Arithmetic Operations: Examples of performing arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) using bitwise operators.
Bitwise Tricks and Optimizations: Advanced techniques and optimizations for efficient bit manipulation.
