0x0C. C - More malloc, free
The 0x0C-more_malloc_free is a project in the C programming language that is focused on dynamic memory allocation using the malloc and free functions. 
In this project, I'm going to demonstrate how to allocate memory dynamically, which means that they can request memory from the operating system during runtime and release it when it is no longer needed. This is different from static memory allocation, where memory is allocated at compile-time and cannot be changed during runtime.

The project covers various topics related to dynamic memory allocation, such as memory leaks, buffer overflows, and segmentation faults. Students also learn how to use tools like valgrind to detect memory errors and debug their programs.
